# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview
Personal portfolio repository containing resume in multiple formats (Markdown, PDF).

## Structure
```
resume/
  en.md       # English Resume (clean version for sharing)
  vi.md       # Vietnamese Resume (clean version for sharing)
  vi-raw.md   # Vietnamese raw notes (internal use, NOT for sharing)
```

## Conventions
- `vi-raw.md` is the source of truth for detailed info; sync to `en.md` and `vi.md`
- Keep clean resumes concise and professional; raw file contains full details
- Use consistent Markdown formatting across all resume files
- Emoji icons allowed in clean resumes for visual appeal
- File links use relative paths within resume/ directory

## Content Guidelines
- Do NOT include projects marked "không nên đưa vào CV" in clean versions
- Tech Lead role: SLC (current), SRMA (later phase)
- Event Sourcing → use "Event-Driven Architecture" instead (per notes)
- Start date at Onschool: 11/2022
